Although the LSTM-based HC classiﬁer\nobtains the highest accuracy, it is time-consuming for building\nthe model. Due to the SVM-based HC algorithm adopting the\nlinear kernel function, it takes more time to search the optimal\nsolution. In the same case, the k-NN-based approach is the\nfastest method to establish the HC classiﬁer, while the DT-based\nclassiﬁer is the fastest algorithm to predict the activity. Moreover,\nthe testing accuracy displays that putting the smartphone in the\npocket acquires more noises than carrying the smartphone on\nthe waist. The results for the average testing time and training\ntime computed on the compressed dataset are signiﬁcantly less\nthan those for the uncompressed dataset. Hence, compressing the\ntraining datasets saves more time for building a new classiﬁer.\nEven if the accuracy obtained on the uncompressed dataset is\ngreater than that on the compressed dataset, it is time-consuming\nto build the classiﬁer and predict an activity. Moreover, the trust\ndegree η can be adjusted to increase the accuracy using (7).\nB. Online Learning Examination\nThis experiment aims to prove the updating ability of Ada-\nHAR system for recognizing a new activity. Two new activities\n(squats and twisting hips) were collected from one subject\ncarrying the smartphone on the waist or put in the left pocket,\nrespectively. To conﬁrm that the proposed signal processing al-\ngorithms could overcome the effect of changing the direction of\nmobile phone, we combined the collected data of two directions\nwith the same testing protocol (shown in each top graph of\nFig. 6). The DL-based HC algorithm was not adopted because\nthe training procedure is costly. The experiments adopted an\nonline batch learning mechanism. The SVM method used the\nGaussian kernel. The built ML-based classiﬁers for identifying\nthe 12 original activities were used to predict the new activity\non the four datasets. The following four experiments were per-\nformed to evaluate the adaptive performance of both compressed\nand uncompressed datasets.\nFig. 6(a) displays a comparison results of the online accuracy\nand computational time for predicting squats by carrying the\nmobile phone on the waist. The top graph is the collected 3-axis\nacceleration with two directions. The middle graph is the online\nclassiﬁcation accuracy computed by (1) and (2) at time (epoch)t.\nBoth k-NN and SVM methods obtain a higher accuracy than the\nother methods. The bottom graph is the online predicting time.\nThe amplitudes ofk-NN, DT, and SVM are 0.05 s, while the other\napproaches require more than 1 s to predict activity. Hence, the\nk-NN-based HC classiﬁer is the best method for recognizing\nthe new activity. Fig. 6(b) portrays the results of predicting\nsquats by putting the mobile phone in the left pant pocket.

Machine learning and deep learning\n(DL) techniques are widely utilized for the scientiﬁc study of the\nstatistical models of human behaviors. However, the performance\nof existing HAR platforms is limited by complex physical activity.\nIn this article, we proposed an adaptive recognition and real-time\nmonitoring system for human activities (Ada-HAR), which is ex-\npected to identify more human motions in dynamic situations. The\nAda-HAR framework introduces an unsupervised online learning\nalgorithm that is independent of the number of class constraints.\nFurthermore, the adopted hierarchical clustering and classiﬁca-\ntion algorithms label and classify 12 activities (ﬁve dynamics, six\nstatics, and a series of transitions) autonomously. Finally, practical\nexperiments have been performed to validate the effectiveness and\nrobustness of the proposed algorithms. Compared with the methods\nmentioned in the literature, the results show that the DL-based\nclassiﬁer obtains a higher recognition rate (95.15%, waist, and\n92.20%, pocket). The decision-tree-based classiﬁer is the fastest\nmethod for modal evolution. Finally, the Ada-HAR system can\nmonitor human activity in real time, regardless of the direction\nof the smartphone.\nIndex Terms —Data compression, deep learning (DL),\nhierarchical classiﬁcation (HC), human activity recognition\n(HAR).\nI. INTRODUCTION\nR\nECOGNIZING human activities using inertial sensors in\na smartphone has attracted increasing research interests\nduring the past decades in various domains, ranging from home\nhealthcare to sports monitoring, rehabilitation, personalized\nmedicine, and mental disorders [1]. Recently, with the develop-\nment of the Internet of Things, machine learning (ML), and deep\nlearning (DL) techniques, human activity recognition (HAR)\ncan be achieved by transferring data in the body area networks\nand wireless Ethernet, allowing the assessment of the human\nphysical and physiological status [2]. However, many studies\ndevelop appropriate tasks for a given HAR system by resorting\nto extensive heuristic knowledge [3].

Demonstration\nThe video experiment of Ada-HAR demonstrates the recog-\nnition process in real time by changing the direction of the\nsmartphone with two positions. The mean transmission time\nof local network is shorter than that of remote connection. For\nexample, it only cost 0.18 s to receive ten new samples in the\nlocal network, while it needed 0.25 s for the remote transmission.\nEach result was obtained as the average of 100 repetitions.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nIn this article, we proposed a smartphone-based adaptive\nrecognition and real-time monitoring system (Ada-HAR) for\nhuman activities. Experiments were performed with 25 subjects\nto validate the performance of the developed system. The most\ninnovative part was the online learning algorithm. It was capable\nof updating the classiﬁer in a dynamic environment, i.e., which\nmeans if any new activity is found, the HC classiﬁer will be\nupdated automatically to include the new class. It is an unsu-\npervised online learning algorithm that does not need to get the\ntrue labels. In addition to the adaptive algorithm, an automatic\nlabeling method using Hk-mC algorithm was another original\nachievement that improves the efﬁciency of labeling the raw\nsignals. The experiments proved its robustness by placing the\nsmartphone on different positions with various directions.

For\nexample, it only cost 0.18 s to receive ten new samples in the\nlocal network, while it needed 0.25 s for the remote transmission.\nEach result was obtained as the average of 100 repetitions.\nVI. CONCLUSION\nIn this article, we proposed a smartphone-based adaptive\nrecognition and real-time monitoring system (Ada-HAR) for\nhuman activities. Experiments were performed with 25 subjects\nto validate the performance of the developed system. The most\ninnovative part was the online learning algorithm. It was capable\nof updating the classiﬁer in a dynamic environment, i.e., which\nmeans if any new activity is found, the HC classiﬁer will be\nupdated automatically to include the new class. It is an unsu-\npervised online learning algorithm that does not need to get the\ntrue labels. In addition to the adaptive algorithm, an automatic\nlabeling method using Hk-mC algorithm was another original\nachievement that improves the efﬁciency of labeling the raw\nsignals. The experiments proved its robustness by placing the\nsmartphone on different positions with various directions. The\nintroduced signal preprocessing strategy provides stable inputs\nfor the classiﬁer regardless of the",

The meanings of\nthe symbols are as follows: Standard deviationσ, average (e.g.,\n¯∑ Sβ), maximummax, minimummin, difference (recurrence\nrelation) ▽ , and the whole numbers (N).\nB. Creation Module\nThe creation module includes two steps: One aims to achieve\nautomatic labeling using the Hk-mC algorithm, and the other\none is to build the HC classiﬁer for HAR. The Hk-mC algo-\nrithm 1 is implemented in an unsupervised manner with the\nﬁxed structure. It labels the extracted features setFmjj\ns∗p\n,jj =\n1,2,...,Ly m computed on the processed segments s∗\np,p =\n1,2,...,M (lines 2 and 3). For each layer, it calculates a parti-\ntion of a dissimilarity object consisting ofkk ≤ nc medoids.\nGiven a set of M data objects S = sp, the objective is to\npartition the dataset intonc classes, with each cluster having one\nrepresentative object known as a medoidsm\njj [33].

In this article,η =0 .8.\nV. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS\nThree experiments were designed to validate the claims about\nthe Ada-HAR system in Section I. The ﬁrst experiment of the HC\nalgorithm evaluation aimed to compare the performance among\nML-based and DL-based HC classiﬁers. The second experiment\nwas to validate the evolution ability of the Ada-HAR system.\nThe demonstration revealed the identiﬁcation capability of Ada-\nHAR system in real time. The experiments have implemented\nthese methods in MATLAB 2018b with the hardware platform of\nIntel(R) i7 Core, 2.80-GHz CPU, and 16.0-GB RAM. A 64-bit\niPhone 6 s (2-core CPU) was utilized for collecting data with a\n50-Hz sampling frequency.\nA. HC Algorithm Evaluation\nTwenty-ﬁve subjects (13 females and 12 males, age range\n18–40 years old) were asked to perform the 12 original activities\ndescribed in Section I in a ﬁxed order (shown in Fig. 4). They\ncarried the smartphone on the waist or put it in their left pant\npocket, respectively. Finally, 50 datasets (25 datasets for each\nposition) were collected for further analysis.\nWe adopt the leave-one-out cross-validation strategy to vali-\ndate the performance of HC classiﬁers [40]. The length of the\ndetection window is 150 samples (3 s), and the overlap is 1 s\n(50 estimates). Table III reports a comparison of the average and\nstandard deviation in terms of the accuracy, training time, and\naverage test time among ML-based (i.e.,k-NN, DT, NB, ANN,\nand SVM) and DL-based (LSTM) HC classiﬁers. Meanwhile,\nall of the HC classiﬁers are evaluated on uncompressed and no-\ncompressed datasets. Although the LSTM-based HC classiﬁer\nobtains the highest accuracy, it is time-consuming for building\nthe model. Due to the SVM-based HC algorithm adopting the\nlinear kernel function, it takes more time to search the optimal\nsolution. In the same case, the k-NN-based approach is the\nfastest method to establish the HC classiﬁer, while the DT-based\nclassiﬁer is the fastest algorithm to predict the activity. Moreover,\nthe testing accuracy displays that putting the smartphone in the\npocket acquires more noises than carrying the smartphone on\nthe waist. The results for the",

However, it will\ncost ample time to optimize the parameters of the LSTM network\nand predict a result.\nC.

METHODOLOGY\nFig. 2 shows the proposed Ada-HAR system with cre-\nation, recognition, and online learning modules. In the creation\nmodule, the Hk-mC [6] is adopted to label the activities au-\ntonomously. The HC [7] algorithms are used to establish the\nclassiﬁer for recognizing the 12 original activities (described in\nSection I). In the recognition module, the obtained HC classiﬁer\nis implemented for HAR in real time by carrying a smartphone\non the waist or putting it in the left pant pocket. In the online\nlearning module, a new activity that is not included in the 12\noriginal activities will be identiﬁed in an unsupervised learning\nmanner. Meanwhile, the old classiﬁer is updated. The signal\npreprocessing and feature extraction models are shared in both\ncreation and recognition modules.\nA. Signal Preprocessing and Feature Extraction\nThe collected signals typically exhibit various turbulence\n(e.g., magnetic ﬁelds and movement artifact), which affects the\nrecognition ability of the classiﬁer.
