Finally, the average Fscore\nis observed to be 90.8%, where maximum is Normal 92.8%\nand minimum for Abnormal 88.8% respectively.\nAlso, it is observed that the developed classiﬁcation model\noffers a latency of 20 ms for an image to be classiﬁed\nwhen running on an Intel i7 processor with 16 GB RAM.\nHowever, it is observed that in most of the cases, the latency\ndoes not exceed 150 ms with moderate network connectivity\n(approximately 2 Mbps bandwidth).

CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we proposed and developed a low-cost and\neasily scalable eHealth architecture comprising of a web\napplication for automatic classiﬁcation of fatty liver using\nultrasound images. The developed web application is easy to\nuse and requires no change in the current infrastructure. The\nultrasound images obtained using the traditional ultrasound\nscanners can be uploaded to the developed web application\nusing moderate network connectivity and the web application\nthen classiﬁes the image into either normal or abnormal using\na CNN based framework. The performance of the proposed\nframework is tested with with 58 ultrasound images, we have\ndeveloped a custom database comprising of 58 ultrasound\nimages with liver information of which 36 correspond to liver\nimages are normal conditions and the rest correspond to a fatty\nliver condition. It is observed that the proposed framework\nachieves an average accuracy of 91.37%. Also, the latency\nanalysis shows that the proposed CNN model predicts within\n20 ms when running on a PC with Intel i7 processor and 16 GB\nRAM. Also when considered along with the network latency\nthe total latency observed is approximately 150 ms when used\nwith moderate network connectivity. Hence, we strongly feel\nthat the proposed eHealth framework will help future research\nin developing low-cost, easily scalable and ubiquitous eHealth\nframeworks. Our future scope of this work is to develop a more\nrobust classiﬁcation framework which can eliminate the false\nnegatives. Also, we would like to consider real-time trials in\ncoordination with hospitals to analyze the performance in real\nconstraints.\nVI.

D EVELOPED CNN BASED ACCURATE FATTY LIVER\nCLASSIFICATION FRAMEWORK\nIn [19], we have developed a novel CNN based accurate\nfatty liver classiﬁcation model using ultrasound images. The\nsame model is adopted in this paper for the classiﬁcation of\nfatty liver using ultrasound images. The architecture comprises\nof a pre-trained VGG-16 model along with the transfer learn-\ning and ﬁne-tuning. VGGNet using CNN is initially designed\nwith different layer depths aiming for image recognition tasks.\nPreliminary analysis of VGGNet offered a promising accuracy\nof 92.7% when validated using the ImagNet dataset com-\nprising of 14 million images from 1000 classes [20]. In this\npaper, we make use the 16 layers VGG-16 with convolution\nblocks(including convolution layers and max-pooling layers)\nand a fully connected classiﬁer. The ﬁne-tuning is carried out\nusing the pre-trained VGG-16 model in Keras. Traditionally,\nthe convolution 2D layers in VGG-16 consists of 512 nodes for\nconvolution layers, however, in our experiment we ﬁne-tuned\nthe network from using 512 nodes to 256 nodes. Also, we ﬁne-\ntuned fully connected layers having 4096 nodes to 256 nodes,\nand the output layer comprises two neurons whose output\ncorresponds to the two classes (normal and abnormal) in this\nstudy. During the training of the model, the weight parameters\nof the output layer are initialized using random Gaussian\ndistribution, and the training is performed over 100 epochs.\nSince the development of the CNN based accurate fatty liver\nclassiﬁcation framework is not our primary contribution in this\npaper, we would like to advise the readers to kindly refer [19]\nfor more details on the developed model. However, we would\nlike to highlight that the database used for validation in [19]\nis different from what we used here.\nIV. R ESULTS\nThe publicly available datasets for ultrasound images of the\nliver are very few. Hence, due to the unavailability of the\npublic datasets, we acquired and developed our own dataset\nusing a GE LOGIQ F6 ultrasound scanner in collaboration\nwith MNR Medical College, Sangareddy, Hyderabad, India.\nThe dataset consisted of 58 representative liver images com-\nprising of both fatty liver (22 images) and normal conditions\n(36 images). We cropped the images which does not convey\nany diagnostic information such as hospital name, time of the\ndiagnosis, etc. Also, since the pre-trained models are trained\nwith an input image size of 224×224 pixels, the images of\nour dataset were also resized to 224×224 pixels for compat-\nibility. The performance of the proposed model is analyzed\nconsidering classiﬁcation accuracy, confusion matrix, Fscore,\nPrecision, and Recall as the key performance metrics.

Rajalakshmi\nWiNet Research Lab, Department of Electrical Engineering\nIndian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, India\nEmail: ee15resch11005, raji@iith.ac.in\nAbstract—Medical imaging techniques are being profoundly\nused for diagnosis of many diseases. In many of the remote areas\nin the developing nations, patients who live in rural areas are\nfacing vital health disparities compared to the general population.\nIn such scenarios, eHealth can offer promising solutions. The\neHealth especially aims at developing digital applications for\noffering high accuracy diagnosis even in remote areas. Also,\nthe integration of eHealth with advanced technologies such as\ndeep learning and artiﬁcial intelligence will further improve\nthe diagnostic accuracy and also reduces the duration. In this\npaper, we develop a novel low-cost and easily scalable eHealth\narchitecture comprising of a web application which enables\nclinicians in fatty liver classiﬁcation using ultrasound images.\nThe developed web application framework uses a deep learning\nmodel (using CNN) for accurate classiﬁcation of fatty liver\nusing ultrasound images. The clinician in a remote location\nwith a moderate internet connectivity can upload the scanned\nultrasound image to the developed web application and the\napplication identiﬁes if any abnormality is present. From the\nperformance analysis, it is observed that the developed model\nachieves an accuracy of 91.37%. Also, regarding latency the\ndeveloped classiﬁcation model predicts the abnormality presence\nin less than 20 ms. However, including the network latency, it is\nobserved that the developed eHealth architecture predicts with a\nlatency of less than 150 ms using moderate network connectivity.\nIndex Terms—eHealth, Artiﬁcial Intelligence, Fatty liver clas-\nsiﬁcation, Ultrasound, CAD, IoT Architecture\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly proliferating into\nmany sectors including healthcare. Today most of the health-\ncare services starting from in-hospital patient care to remote\nhealthcare are utilizing IoT technologies to improve the af-\nfordability and reachability [1]. Especially in the developing\ncountries where healthcare providers are inadequate compared\nto the total population, this can be a promising solution [2].\nIn the recent past many technologies such as wearables for\nautomated electrocardiogram monitoring, glucose and blood\npressure monitoring, and epilepsy detection have been devel-\noped at low cost using IoT technologies [3], [4]. However,\nthere is a long way to go before the healthcare becomes truly\npervasive and ubiquitous, especially in the developing nations.\nImportantly, in the case of medical imaging technologies, the\nhigh cost of the infrastructure is hindering the adoption of\nIoT technologies which realizes the telemedicine or remote\nhealthcare delivery [5]. Due to the lack of skilled sonographers\nor physicians in the rural areas, the majority of people are\nsuffering from inaccurate diagnosis being offered by the semi-\nskilled clinicians. Especially, the ultrasound imaging which\nis a widely used modality for diagnosing various diseases\npertaining to multiple organs requires skilled clinicians for\noffering accurate diagnosis [6]. Hence, we strongly feel that\nthe usage of IoT and artiﬁcial intelligence based technologies\nwill signiﬁcantly improve the current state of the healthcare.\nIn this paper, our primary contributions include:\n1) Developed a novel low-cost and scalable eHealth archi-\ntecture for classifying the fatty liver using ultrasound\nimages.\n2) Developed a web application that enables sonographers\nin the remote areas for classifying the fatty liver by\nuploading the scanned ultrasound images.\n3) The web application developed using a convolution",

In promoting universal\nhealth coverage, eHealth plays an important role by provid-\ning low cost healthcare services to remote and under-served\npopulations. It improves the accuracy of diagnosis by uti-\nlizing IoT and artiﬁcial intelligence technologies. Ultrasound\nscanners are usually located in well-established hospitals due\nto their huge form factor, cost and need for a person who\nis well trained in sonography. With the advancements in\ncomputing technology, conventional ultrasound scanner are\nreduced to portable ultrasound scanners for improving the\nease of scanning in rural and emergency locations [8], [9].\nAlso, they support IoT technologies wherein a doctor situated978-1-5386-4980-0/19/$31.00 ©2019 IEEE\n2019 IEEE 5th World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT)\n978-1-5386-4980-0/19/$31.00 ©2019 IEEE 502\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Universiteit Leiden.

However, many hospitals located in both urban and rural\nareas still use the traditional ultrasound scanners which do not\nsupport remote administration due to multiple factors such as\nlack of investment [10], [11].\nAuthors in [12] developed a low-cost portable system to\nperform obstetric ultrasonography to monitor baby in the\nwomb using an eHealth architecture.

Developed web interface along with the ultrasound and prediction\nwhen tested using a liver image with a fatty liver condition.\nIII. D EVELOPED CNN BASED ACCURATE FATTY LIVER\nCLASSIFICATION FRAMEWORK\nIn [19], we have developed a novel CNN based accurate\nfatty liver classiﬁcation model using ultrasound images. The\nsame model is adopted in this paper for the classiﬁcation of\nfatty liver using ultrasound images. The architecture comprises\nof a pre-trained VGG-16 model along with the transfer learn-\ning and ﬁne-tuning. VGGNet using CNN is initially designed\nwith different layer depths aiming for image recognition tasks.\nPreliminary analysis of VGGNet offered a promising accuracy\nof 92.7% when validated using the ImagNet dataset com-\nprising of 14 million images from 1000 classes [20]. In this\npaper, we make use the 16 layers VGG-16 with convolution\nblocks(including convolution layers and max-pooling layers)\nand a fully connected classiﬁer. The ﬁne-tuning is carried out\nusing the pre-trained VGG-16 model in Keras. Traditionally,\nthe convolution 2D layers in VGG-16 consists of 512 nodes for\nconvolution layers, however, in our experiment we ﬁne-tuned\nthe network from using 512 nodes to 256 nodes. Also, we ﬁne-\ntuned fully connected layers having 4096 nodes to 256 nodes,\nand the output layer comprises two neurons whose output\ncorresponds to the two classes (normal and abnormal) in this\nstudy. During the training of the model, the weight parameters\nof the output layer are initialized using random Gaussian\ndistribution, and the training is performed over 100 epochs.\nSince the development of the CNN based accurate fatty liver\nclassiﬁcation framework is not our primary contribution in this\npaper, we would like to advise the readers to kindly refer [19]\nfor more details on the developed model. However, we would\nlike to highlight that the database used for validation in [19]\nis different from what we used here.\nIV. R ESULTS\nThe publicly available datasets for ultrasound images of the\nliver are very few. Hence, due to the unavailability of the\npublic datasets, we acquired and developed our own dataset\nusing a GE LOGIQ F6 ultrasound scanner in collaboration\nwith MNR Medical College, Sangareddy, Hyderabad, India.\nThe dataset consisted of 58 representative liver images com-\nprising of both fatty liver (22 images) and normal conditions\n(36 images). We cropped the images which does not convey\nany diagnostic information such as hospital name, time of the\ndiagnosis, etc. Also, since the pre-trained models are trained\nwith an input image size of 224×224 pixels, the images of\nour dataset were also resized to 224×224 pixels for compat-\nibility. The performance of the proposed model is analyzed\nconsidering classiﬁcation accuracy, confusion matrix, Fscore,\nPrecision, and Recall as the key performance metrics. The\ndescription of the considered performance metrics are given\nbelow:\nFscore = 2 recall∗precision\n(recall+precision) , (1)\nR\necall = N(TP )\nN(T\nP) +N(FN ) , (2)\nP\nrecision = N(TP )\nN(T\nP) +N(FP ) , (3)\n2019 IEEE 5th World Forum on Internet of Things (WF-IoT)\n504\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Universiteit Leiden.

CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we proposed and developed a low-cost and\neasily scalable eHealth architecture comprising of a web\napplication for automatic classiﬁcation of fatty liver using\nultrasound images. The developed web application is easy to\nuse and requires no change in the current infrastructure. The\nultrasound images obtained using the traditional ultrasound\nscanners can be uploaded to the developed web application\nusing moderate network connectivity and the web application\nthen classiﬁes the image into either normal or abnormal using\na CNN based framework. The performance of the proposed\nframework is tested with with 58 ultrasound images, we have\ndeveloped a custom database comprising of 58 ultrasound\nimages with liver information of which 36 correspond to liver\nimages are normal conditions and the rest correspond to a fatty\nliver condition. It is observed that the proposed framework\nachieves an average accuracy of 91.37%. Also, the latency\nanalysis shows that the proposed CNN model predicts within\n20 ms when running on a PC with Intel i7 processor and 16 GB\nRAM. Also when considered along with the network latency\nthe total latency observed is approximately 150 ms when used\nwith moderate network connectivity. Hence, we strongly feel\nthat the proposed eHealth framework will help future research\nin developing low-cost, easily scalable and ubiquitous eHealth\nframeworks. Our future scope of this work is to develop a more\nrobust classiﬁcation framework which can eliminate the false\nnegatives. Also, we would like to consider real-time trials in\ncoordination with hospitals to analyze the performance in real\nconstraints.\nVI.
