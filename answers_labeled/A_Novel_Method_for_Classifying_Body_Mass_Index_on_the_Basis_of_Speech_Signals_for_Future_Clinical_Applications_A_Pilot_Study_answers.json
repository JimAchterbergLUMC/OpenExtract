        " minimal network or\ntelephone time and communication equipment. Because a\ngreat deal of medical information is needed for patient care\nand prognosis prediction [30, 31], telemedicine or remote\nhealthcare system facilitates the quality and quantity of data\ncollection and integration, communication between patients\nand healthcare systems, preprocessing to optimize medical\ntreatment,anddecisionsupportandmodificationofmedical\ntreatment primarily using telephones, computers, fax, and\nWCU VC (virtual community program) [32–34]. Also, the\ntechnologies have the advantages of health improvement,\npatient convenience, cost effectiveness, economy of time,\ndata accuracy and permanence, and continuous real-time\nmonitoringofchronicdisease[ 35–37].\nOur contributions in this study are as follows: we first\npropose a method for classifying the normal weight or\nthe high weight using speech signals in age-and gender-\nspecific groups. Our method may apply to the development\nof advanced and automatic methods for individual BMI\nd i a g n o s i si nt e l e m e d i c i n ea n du - h e a l t h c a r ea n da s s i s ti nt h e\ndevelopmentofasimplersystemforBMImeasurement.Also,\nour suggestion that is possible to support context awareness\nmayprovidecluestoimprovetheoverallqualityofemergency\nservice via automatic support of patient BMI information\nin remote healthcare systems with limited resources. We\nfind discriminatory and meaningful features for normal and\noverweight diagnoses via a statistical analysis between BMI\nandspeechfeaturesandidentifyacompactandusefulfeature\nsubset in accordance with the age-and gender-specific anal-\nysis. The results will serve to create a better discriminatory\nfeaturesetandaccurateclassificationmodelsinthisfield.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1.DataPreparation\n2.1.1. Data Collection.

Each\nsentence was recorded twice, and the value of each feature\nwas obtained by averaging the values of the 2 recordings for\nmorestablefeatures.\nAll features were extracted using 5 vowels (A, E, I,\nO, U) and 1 sentence [38]. For speech feature extraction,\nwe extracted 65 features from the collected data set. The\nextracted features consisted of pitch, average ratio of pitch\nperiod, correlation coefficient between F0 and intensity\n(CORR), absolute Jitter (Jita), and Mel frequency cepstral\ncoefficients (MFCC), among others [18, 23, 27].

Class Label Decision for Normal and Overweight Sta-\ntuses. Obesity and BMI research is difficult due to different\nethnic groups and different national economic statuses [7].\nAlso, BMI values differ according to physiological factors\nand environmental factors, such as residing in a city or a\nrural area. For instance, BMI values of a population in an\nAsian region tend to be lower than those of a population\nin a Western region, whereas Asians have risk factors for\ncardiovascular disease and diabetes related to obesity at\nrelatively low BMI values [9, 39]. The BMI cutoff values for\noverweight and obesity depend on several factors including\nethnicity,rural/urbanresidence,andeconomicstatus[ 7,40].\nTherefore, we decided that this study’s overweight cutoff\npoint of BMI value was≥23kg/m\n2, according to suggestions\nby the World Health Organization and references [39, 41,\n42]. We refer here to only 2 classes: the “normal” and the\n“overweight.” Subjects in the BMI who range from 18.5 to\n22.9 were labeled normal, and subjects with a BMI of 23\nor over were labeled as overweight. Underweight patients\nwere passed over due the lack of a minimum number of\nsubjects. Finally, we divided the data set into 6 groups for\nage-andgender-specificclassification:female:20–30(females\naged20–39years),female:40–50(femalesaged40–59years),\nfemale: 60 (females aged 60 years and over), male: 20–30\n(males aged 20–39 years), male: 40–50 (males aged 40–59\nyears),andmale:60(malesaged60yearsandover).\nThe overall mean ages of the female and male subjects\nwere41.79and40.51,respectively.Themean",

Introduction\nWorldwide, increasing numbers of people are becoming\nobese, including adults, adolescents, and children and both\nmenandwoman[ 1,2].Obesityreferstoexcessadiposetissue\ncausedbygeneticdeterminants,excessiveeating,insufficient\nphysical movement, and an inappropriate lifestyle [1, 3, 4].\nObesity and being overweight are serious public health\nproblems; obesity has a direct relationship with physical\nhealth and psychological health and is a potential risk\nfactor for many diseases, including cardiovascular diseases,\nstroke, ischemic heart disease, diabetes, and cancer [2, 5–\n8]. Therefore, it is important to recognize when patients are\noverweightorobese,andmanystudieshavebeenperformed\nabout the relationship of obesity, as determined by body\nmassindex(BMI),anddisease[ 4,6,7,9–11].BMI,proposed\nby Lambert Adolphe Jacques Quetelet, is a measurement\ncriterion presenting the relationship between body weight\nand height [3]a n dac o m m o n l yu s e dp u b l i ch e a l t hm e t h o d\nfor classifying underweight, normal, overweight, and obese\npatients.\nOn the other hand, research on the association of body\nshape (weight, height),"

An ROC curve\n(receiver operating characteristic curve) represents the bal-\nance of sensitivity versus 1 specificity [50]. Because the AUC\nis a threshold-independent measure, AUC is a widely used\ntoquantifythequalityofapredictionorclassificationmodel\nin medical science, bioinformatics, medicine statistics, and\nbiology [31, 51–53].
