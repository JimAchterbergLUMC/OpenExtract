The system ﬂowchart is\nshown in Fig. 5 .\nDue to the lack of dental diseases standard data sets, we\nworked with some dental clinics (such as Beijing Mei-Xiao\ndental clinics). With the consent of the subjects, 300 subjects\nuse dental image acquisition device to sample the dental diseases\nvideo data, and the algorithm analyzes each frame of video, and\n3835 images of dental cases are sampled ﬁnally. These clinics\nalready have 8,765 images of dental cases, with a total of 12,600\nclinical images being collected. These images are classiﬁed into\n7 different types as shown in Table I, with the 7 types of dental\ndiseases as follows: dental caries, dental uorosis, periodontal\ndisease, cracked tooth, dental calculus, dental plaque, and tooth\nloss. 4/5 of these data was used in training, while 1/5 of them was\nin model testing, training data set and test data are respectively\nfrom different objects, thus without overlap between the testing\ndataset and the training dataset.\nB. Build Sample Set\nThe semi-automatic labeling method is applied to establish\nthe training sample set to improve the efﬁciency. The dental im-\nages were initially labeled by the design of detector for 7 types\nof dental diseases, as shown in Fig. 5 , the functions of the de-\ntector here include image enhancement, color texture matching,\ncoarse localization and classiﬁcation of disease. Followed by\nthe conﬁrmation of images with labeling error or classiﬁcation\nerror through manual screening method, the training samples\nset were ﬁnally calibrated by 20 dental disease experts, with the\ndetails as follows:\n1) Image Enhancement: In some dental images, the features\nof the tooth disease site without very high contrast are not very\nobvious, thereby making it necessary to enhance the images\nbefore designing the classiﬁcation algorithms. The Retinex al-\ngorithm is used [17], which adaptively prompts various types\nof images to achieve balance in dynamic range, edge, and color.\nThe image enhancement effect in Fig. 6 shows that the color\nand texture details of the dental disease are highlighted after the\nenhancement.\n2) Coarse Localization and Classiﬁcation of Dental Disease\nTarget Area: It is just a preliminary detecting, and only the areas\nclose to the color and texture of the image to be matched will\nbe detected as samples. Firstly, a histogram matching method\nwith fast calculation speed is used to select the region of color\nproximity, followed by the use of the Tamura texture feature\nAuthorized licensed use limited to: Universiteit Leiden.

Labelme tool is used to gen-\nerate mask data set, along with description of the segmentation\nregion of dental disease as accurate as possible with multiple key\npoints. We delete the wrong label positions and ﬁx the wrong\ntags through articial selection, along with the possible adding of\nthe undetected target images. The nished data is applied as the\ntraining sample data for the detection and classication of dental\ndiseases, ending up with the summary of the recorded frame\nimages to establish the dental training sample set.\nC. Model Training\nCommon target detection algorithms including RCNN,\nYOLO, SSD [19] only classify the target in the image. However,\nthe accurate target segmentation is benecial to the auxiliary med-\nical diagnosis, to achieve the aim of fast and accurate detection\nof dental diseases and dental area accurate segmentation. Based\non the established dental sample library, the MASK R-CNN\nmethod is chosen for the accurate detection and segmentation\nof the dental target.\nThe designed MASK R-CNN network is shown in the left\nof Fig. 6 , in which, MASK R-CNN adds a branch predicting\nthe segmentation mask in each interested area based on Faster\nR-CNN [20]. In Faster R-CNN, region of interest (RoI) pool\nis used to extract the small features from each RoI. Firstly,\nRoIPool scales the RoI represented by oating point numbers to\nFig. 7. Left: MASK R-CNN network. Right: example detections using\nMASK R-CNN on dental images test.\nthe granularity matching the feature graph, followed by parti-\ntioning of the scaled ROI, ending up with the summary of the\ncharacteristic value of each block coverage area. Such calcula-\ntions misplace the ROI and the extracted features, which, though\npossibly not affecting the classication, for the classication has\nthe certain robustness to the small amplitude transformation,\nexerts a great negative impact on the prediction of the precise\nmask of pixel level. Mask R-CNN proposes the RoI Align layer\nto remove the dislocation of RoIPool and aligns the extracted\nfeatures with the input accurately. In RoI Align, a bilinear in-\nterpolation is used to calculate the exact value of each position,\nalong with the summary of the results by using the maximum\nor average pooling, and the extracted features and input can be\naligned with the pixel to pixel, thereby improving the segmen-\ntation accuracy effectively. For the lower convolution network\nused for feature extraction on the whole image, the ResNet-50-\nC4 backbone [20], [21] is adopted with the depth of 50 layers,\nand extract features from the nal convolution layer of the fourth\nstage in the MASK R-CNN. For the upper network, we extend\nthe Faster R-CNN upper network proposed in ResNet, adding a\nmask branch respectively. TensorFlow and Mask R-CNN open\nsource are adopted in the training model, along with modiﬁca-\ntion of ShapesCong class, and GPU COUNT and IMAGES PER\nGPU are set to 1 according to the training server conguration.\nAt the same time, according to the training sample library, cate-\ngories NUM CLASSES, image size IMAGE MIN DIM and the\nsize of the anchor RPN AN"

C ONCLUSION\nThis paper proposes an iHome smart dental Health-IoT sys-\ntem based on intelligent hardware, deep learning and mobile\nterminal, aiming to regulate as well as optimize the accessibil-\nity of dental treatment and provide home-based dental health\ncare service more efciently. The trained model was used to\nrealize the detection and classication of dental diseases, and\napplication software (Apps) on mobile terminal was designed\nfor client-side and dentist-side. The software platform with the\nfunctions including pre-examination of dental disease, consulta-\ntion, appointment, and evaluation, etc, made the service docking\nbetween the patient and the dentist resources a reality. The AI\nalgorithm achieved more than 90% recognition rate for seven\ndental diseases., which has greatly improved the patient rate and\nthe resource utilization rate of the dental clinic through a one-\nmonth systematic testing in 10 private dental clinics, showing\nhigh reliability in practical application.\nREFERENCES\n[1] Z.

The intelligent dental image acquisition device hardware\ndiagram.\nC. Intelligent Hardware\nTraditional dental image collection methods can bring about\nthe inconvenience as follows:\nr Dentists are required to acquire knowledge on more shoot-\ning skills;\nr It is necessary to expand the auxiliary equipment such as\nthe oral expander, along with high cost of the SLR camera.\nr Only partial dental images can be obtained\nDue to the peculiarity of oral structure, the general image\nacquisition equipment (e.g. smart cell-phone) cant meet the im-\nage data collection requirement of 6 surfaces of teeth, thereby\nhelping explain that an intelligent dental image acquisition de-\nvice is designed to photograph dental images. As shown in the\nFig. 4 , the intelligent dental image acquisition device is mainly\ncomposed of an image module and the control board, and the\nmicro exible packaging technology is applied to manufacture\nthe image module. On the exible printed circuit board, it is in-\ntegrated with a 1-megapixel CMOS Sensor, the supplementary\nlighting LEDs, and a macro lens to form a module.\nIncluding processing chip, Wi-Fi module, gyroscope, mem-\nory, keys, LEDs, power management and wireless charger, the\nmain board has functions such as video encoding, interface con-\ntrol, light control and task processing. Additionally, the device\ncan be communicated with the mobile terminal through the Wi-\nFi module. When photographing the teeth, the left-side images\nand right-side images are ﬂipped, with the use of a gyroscope\nsensor in the hardware design [16]. Moreover, In the process\nof shooting, the processor can sense the change signal, and then\ncorrect the image position with the software automatically.\nIII. I NTELLIGENT DENT AL DIAGNOSIS\nA.

Apps on Mobile Terminal\nThe intelligent dental Health-IoT platform facilitates the in-\nteraction between the patients and the dentists mainly through\nthe mobile terminal. As shown in Fig. 2 , the application soft-\nware system is designed into four layers, namely, the front-end\nlayer, the cloud-end application programming interface (API)\nlayer, the server & service layer and the database layer.\nComposed of Android, iOS, H5 and web programs, The front-\nend directly interacts with users and the server through the cloud\nservice interface. Additionally, it processes data interaction with\nthe cloud-end APIs.\nFig. 3.

Labelme tool is used to gen-\nerate mask data set, along with description of the segmentation\nregion of dental disease as accurate as possible with multiple key\npoints. We delete the wrong label positions and ﬁx the wrong\ntags through articial selection, along with the possible adding of\nthe undetected target images. The nished data is applied as the\ntraining sample data for the detection and classication of dental\ndiseases, ending up with the summary of the recorded frame\nimages to establish the dental training sample set.\nC. Model Training\nCommon target detection algorithms including RCNN,\nYOLO, SSD [19] only classify the target in the image. However,\nthe accurate target segmentation is benecial to the auxiliary med-\nical diagnosis, to achieve the aim of fast and accurate detection\nof dental diseases and dental area accurate segmentation. Based\non the established dental sample library, the MASK R-CNN\nmethod is chosen for the accurate detection and segmentation\nof the dental target.\nThe designed MASK R-CNN network is shown in the left\nof Fig. 6 , in which, MASK R-CNN adds a branch predicting\nthe segmentation mask in each interested area based on Faster\nR-CNN [20]. In Faster R-CNN, region of interest (RoI) pool\nis used to extract the small features from each RoI. Firstly,\nRoIPool scales the RoI represented by oating point numbers to\nFig. 7.

Right: example detections using\nMASK R-CNN on dental images test.\nthe granularity matching the feature graph, followed by parti-\ntioning of the scaled ROI, ending up with the summary of the\ncharacteristic value of each block coverage area. Such calcula-\ntions misplace the ROI and the extracted features, which, though\npossibly not affecting the classication, for the classication has\nthe certain robustness to the small amplitude transformation,\nexerts a great negative impact on the prediction of the precise\nmask of pixel level. Mask R-CNN proposes the RoI Align layer\nto remove the dislocation of RoIPool and aligns the extracted\nfeatures with the input accurately. In RoI Align, a bilinear in-\nterpolation is used to calculate the exact value of each position,\nalong with the summary of the results by using the maximum\nor average pooling, and the extracted features and input can be\naligned with the pixel to pixel, thereby improving the segmen-\ntation accuracy effectively. For the lower convolution network\nused for feature extraction on the whole image, the ResNet-50-\nC4 backbone [20], [21] is adopted with the depth of 50 layers,\nand extract features from the nal convolution layer of the fourth\nstage in the MASK R-CNN.

A board level prototype of the intelligent dental image acquisition\ndevicet.\nThe algorithm above is followed to train the model following the\n4-step training of Faster R-CNN [22], with the Table II showing\nthe recognition accuracy of each dental disease. The table shows\nthat we can ﬁnd good results achieved by MASK R-CNN even\nunder challenging conditions, such as the reection of saliva,\ntooth gap, etc. The recognition rate of the algorithm is over 90%\nfor these seven major dental diseases, with the recognition rate\nof dental plaque as 100%, and the recognition rate of decayed\ntooth as 90.1%. It is analyzed that relatively low recognition rate\nof decayed tooth is attributed to the device using a xed focus\nlens, which will be affected by the shooting, such as smear\nand defocusing blurring. In addition, coding errors and missing\nframes can also be responsible for it. Compared with the related\nwork in [14], the accuracy of the presented transfer learning\nmethod for the classication of dental caries and periodontitis\nare all 87.5 %. This work achieves an accuracy of 90.1% and\n94.3% respectively, indicating that the classication accuracy of\ncorresponding dental diseases has been greatly improved in our\nwork.\nIV .

Apps on Mobile Terminal\nThe intelligent dental Health-IoT platform facilitates the in-\nteraction between the patients and the dentists mainly through\nthe mobile terminal. As shown in Fig. 2 , the application soft-\nware system is designed into four layers, namely, the front-end\nlayer, the cloud-end application programming interface (API)\nlayer, the server & service layer and the database layer.\nComposed of Android, iOS, H5 and web programs, The front-\nend directly interacts with users and the server through the cloud\nservice interface.
