        " single prediction\nis made collectively on a group of samples (known as a\n“bag”) instead of predicting on individual samples (known\nas “instances”). MIL techniques align well with our time se-\nries data, where during the training phase only 1 label related\nto the subject (bag label) is known while the individual labels\nof the compressed windows (instance labels) remain un-\nknown. In the testing phase the primary objective is to predict\n1 clinical outcome for each subject. The key concept in MIL\nNaseri et al ME-TIME: CVD Detection Using Smartwatches and AI 167\n\nis that each bag of instances is labeled as positive (heart dis-\nease) if it contains a certain amount of positive instances and\nnegative (healthy) if it contains no positive instances (only\nnegative instances). Although traditional MIL approaches\noften classify a bag as positive even with just 1 positive\ninstance, we aim to minimize false-positives by setting a\nthreshold on the number of positive instances required to la-\nbel a bag as positive. This threshold will be determined\nthrough hyperparameter tuning. Thus, instead of learning a\nmodel that predicts the cardiovascular outcome of individual\ninstances, we are learning a model that predicts the outcome\nof a bag of instances.\nAlgorithm validation\nIn our speciﬁc setting where the model encounters data from\npreviously unseen subjects without any prior knowledge, we\nuse leave-p-subjects-out cross-validation (LPSOCV). This\napproach, shown inFigure 4, ensures a more accurate reﬂec-\ntion of real-world situations. LPSOCV involves multiple iter-\nations, or folds, during which data from distinct subjects are\nused for training and validation purposes (ie, the model is\nvalidated on data from subjects that the model is not trained\non), mitigating observation bias.\nMachine learning models are sensitive to the distribution\nof classes. To mitigate potential bias owing to different class\ndistributions in each fold, we incorporate stratiﬁcation during\nthe cross-validation process. This ensures that the ratio of\nnonarrhythmic, atrial ﬁbrillation, and heart failure subjects\nremains approximately consistent and that the inﬂuence of\ninconsistent class distribution across different folds is mini-\nmized.\nHowever, Fitbit time series data exhibit inter-subject vari-\nability resulting from individuals’ distinct physical attri-\nbutes,\n10 making the development of a universally effective\nmodel for “new” subjects challenging. In order to examine\nthe effect of inter-subject variability, we will assess the model\non 2 distinct test sets. Theﬁrst is an external test set that con-\nsists of subjects not previously encountered, randomly\nselected to make up 20% of the total subjects, with an equal\nnumber from each class. This allows us to evaluate the\nmodel’s generalization capabilities. The second test set is\nan internal one, encompassing theﬁnal 20% of data from\nFigure 3 Illustration of multiple-instance learning. The red and blue lines\nindicate bags of heart disease patients and reference subjects. Even though\nthe labels for each instance are not known, for the sake of this example,\nthe plus and minus signs depict time windows where heart disease is present\nor absent, respectively. The decision boundary is depicted by a dotted circle,\nwhere instances within the circle are classiﬁed as heart disease, and instances\noutside the circle are classiﬁed as healthy.\nBox 1. A simple multiple-instance learning\nexample\nMIL is elaborated with an example in 3 steps.\nInitial setup Under traditional supervised learning,\neach window must be annotated to train a machine\nlearning model. However, in our MIL setting (Figure 3),\nonly the bag label is known for the entire set of windows\nrelated to a subject. A bag label is considered negative if",
        " learning is used, where each observation of the data has\na class label. This must be done with ECGs, since photople-\nthysmography or derived signals are difﬁcult to interpret by a\nclinician. This so-called labeling or annotating of signals by\nphysicians is infeasible for the large amounts of (continuous)\ndata required, and therefore semi-automated\n4,5 and fully\nautomated2,3 ECG labeling systems6 have been developed.\nHowever, these still require a lot of manual labor from contin-\nuously monitored users.\nTherefore, the objective of the ME-TIME is (early) detec-\ntion and prevention of heart disease by leveraging time series\ndata from smartwatches, a cloud-based infrastructure, and\nmachine learning algorithms speciﬁcally designed to func-\ntion effectively with minimal labeling efforts.\nMethods\nStudy design and data collection\nME-TIME (registered at ClinicalTrials.gov; ID:\nNCT05802563) is designed as an observational cohort study\nconsisting of 3 data subject groups, as depicted inFigure 1.\nThe ﬁrst group consists of patients with systolic heart failure\n(HF group); the second group consists of patients with docu-\nmented atrial ﬁbrillation (AF group); and the third group,\nserving as a reference, consists of healthy volunteers. The\nrationale for creating distinct AF and HF groups comes\nfrom their unique pathophysiological characteristics. Conse-\nquently, heart rate patterns that are indicative of these dis-\neases might also be different. The HF group consists of 50\nstudy participants with systolic heart failure, deﬁned as a\nleft ventricular ejection fraction,35% without documented\natrial ﬁbrillation. The AF group consists of 50 patients with\ndocumented atrialﬁbrillation (paroxysmal, persistent, or per-\nmanent) without systolic heart failure. Ejection fractions will\nbe assessed from echocardiograms that are made within 1\nyear of inclusion, and if this is not available an echocardio-\ngram will be performed. The reference group consists of\n100 participants without any prior medical history and\nwithout medication use.

Healthy participants are\nrecruited through local advertising. Anyone that is interested\nwill then receive an information brochure and informed con-\nsent form. At least 2 days after the patient’s receipt of the\nbrochure, the research team will call the patient to schedule\nan appointment. During this visit, the patient submits the\nsigned consent form and will undergo an ECG and blood\npressure measurement that will be analyzed by an experi-\nenced cardiologist (I.B.). Participants can use their own Fitbit\nand are otherwise provided with a Fitbit Inspire 2 or Fitbit\nCharge 5 smartwatch. The device type is assigned to a partic-\nipant at random to prevent device sampling bias. This will\nalso help to investigate the effect of device type on the perfor-\nmance of theﬁnal model. A Fitbit account will be created for\nall participants which will be connected to a custom-built\ndata platform using the Google Cloud Platform. Our platform\nfeatures a data portal for research staff to easily register or de-\nregister participants by authorizing a connection to their Fit-\nbit data. Data are extracted daily from Fitbits until the\nobservation period ends and can be analyzed either in the\ncloud or locally.\nAll participants will be asked toﬁll out a survey regarding\ntheir health. All participants are monitored for a period of 3\nmonths. After written consent from the 200 subjects, heart\nrate, step counter, and sleep time series data are extracted\nfrom the data platform. Clinical metadata such as age, height,\nweight, blood pressure at baseline, health survey, and medi-\ncation use are saved in the Castor (Ciwit BV, Amsterdam,\nThe Netherlands) electronic database.\nData privacy\nAfter performing a thorough data protection impact assess-\nment, the local hospital security information and privacy of-\nﬁcers granted permission to perform the study. This was also\nvalidated by the ethics review board. The data protection\nimpact assessment describes a data management plan con-\nforming to the European General Data Protection Regulation.\nTo protect the data privacy of the participants, all data are\npseudonymized.

The step counter is sampled once per minute.\nArtifacts involving samples with numerous consecutive\nconstant values are removed, if more than 12 consecutive\nconstant values (equivalent to 1 minute of heart rate samples)\nare detected. This 1-minute threshold was chosen based on\nvisual inspection, which revealed that heart rate patterns typi-\ncally occur in the order of minutes, often spanning 10–20 mi-\nnutes. For sequences with fewer than 12 consecutive missing\nvalues, linear interpolation is applied. From the cleaned time\nseries, smaller segments, denoted as windows, are extracted\nand employed as input for a machine learning model. This\nprocess involves a sliding window and windows containing\ntime gaps are excluded. Windows have 2 design consider-\nations: the window size, which determines the number of\nsamples within a window and deﬁnes its dimensionality,\nand the stride, which establishes the step size dictating the\nshift between windows.\nAlthough the cardiovascular condition of each subject is\nknown, it is unknown in which speciﬁc windows these con-\nditions manifest themselves. This is owing to the paroxysmal\nnature of atrialﬁbrillation and the variable symptoms of heart\nfailure, which can be inﬂuenced by factors like medication\nadjustments, dietary changes, and the disease’s progressive\ncourse. In other words, the subject label is known, but the in-\ndividual window labels are unknown.

To learn informative\npatterns/features directly from the input data, despite the lack\nof labeled windows, the ﬁrst stage involves using self-\nsupervised learning. A commonly used self-supervised\nlearning technique involves compressing the input windows\nto a lower-dimensional representation and then reconstruct-\ning the original input from this compact representation, as de-\npicted in Figure 2b.\n7,8 Instead of reconstruction, another\ntechnique is to forecast future time points of the input\ndata.9 The second stage involves multiple-instance learning\n(MIL).

This is visually repre-\nsented inFigure 2a, where the subject label is depicted by the\nblue/red colors and the unknown window labels are indicated\nby black dotted lines.\nPlanned machine learning approach\nOur planned machine learning approach is tailored to operate\nin this setting through a 2-stage process. To learn informative\npatterns/features directly from the input data, despite the lack\nof labeled windows, the ﬁrst stage involves using self-\nsupervised learning. A commonly used self-supervised\nlearning technique involves compressing the input windows\nto a lower-dimensional representation and then reconstruct-\ning the original input from this compact representation, as de-\npicted in Figure 2b.\n7,8 Instead of reconstruction, another\ntechnique is to forecast future time points of the input\ndata.9 The second stage involves multiple-instance learning\n(MIL). MIL, depicted inFigure 3and more elaborately ex-\nplained inBox 1, is suitable for data where a single prediction\nis made collectively on a group of samples (known as a\n“bag”) instead of predicting on individual samples (known\nas “instances”). MIL techniques align well with our time se-\nries data, where during the training phase only 1 label related\nto the subject (bag label) is known while the individual labels\nof the compressed windows (instance labels) remain un-\nknown. In the testing phase the primary objective is to predict\n1 clinical outcome for each subject. The key concept in MIL\nNaseri et al ME-TIME: CVD Detection Using Smartwatches and AI 167\n\nis that each bag of instances is labeled as positive (heart dis-\nease) if it contains a certain amount of positive instances and\nnegative (healthy) if it contains",
        "-correlation function\nbetween the heart rate window and its corresponding step\ncounter window is indicative of heart disease. To calculate\nthe correlation, we consider varying window sizes and time\ndifferences (lags) between heart rate and steps. The computed\ncross-correlation matrix for the healthy group, along with the\nAF and HF patient groups, as shown inFigure 7, shows that\nthe heart rate is correlated with the step counter with 1-minute\ndelay.\nDiscussion\nBy building a suitable infrastructure with Cloud technology,\nbig data acquired in the study is used to develop data-efﬁcient\nmodels using methods from multiple instance and self-\nsupervised learning.\nWe aim to examine the inﬂuence of inter-subject vari-\nability on predicting cardiovascular disease and will explore\npotential methods to mitigate these variabilities.\n13,14 We\nexpect that patterns indicative of cardiovascular disease\nbecome apparent within a timeframe of minutes, hours, or\nmore, considering that consumer-grade wearables have a\nslower sampling rate compared to the gold standard. We\nhave shown 1 example of such a pattern: the acceleration-\ndeceleration curve. Preselecting windows based on such\nTable 2 Confusion matrix of per-week healthy vs atrialﬁbrillation\nclassiﬁcation of the MILES model with peak aligned curves\nconcatenated with step counter data, with true and predicted labels\nshown vertically and horizontally, respectively\nTrue/Predicted label AF Healthy\nAF 11 14\nHealthy 7 33\nAF 5 atrial ﬁbrillation.\nFigure 7 Cross-correlation matrices between windowed heart rate data and\nnumber of steps for healthy and the persistent atrialﬁbrillation (AF) group.\nRows are window sizes and columns lag between heart rate and step counter.\nNaseri et al ME-TIME: CVD Detection Using Smartwatches and AI 171\n\npatterns furthermore mitigates searching through substantial\namounts of data that may not provide much information\nabout cardiovascular disease. Inspecting the cross-\ncorrelation for several combinations of window size and\nlag show a different proﬁle for healthy and AF group individ-\nuals, showing that it is meaningful to analyze step counter\nand heart rate together. Big data for heart disease detection\nrequires substantial labeling efforts from physicians.\nUsing self-supervised learning and MIL, a model can be\ntrained with much fewer labels. Ourﬁndings demonstrate\nthis by employing MILES to achieve high speciﬁcity, which\ncan aid in ruling out heart disease in individuals experiencing\nsymptoms similar to heart disease but without the condition\n(ie, false-positives).\nConclusion\nThe ongoing ME-TIME study is a longitudinal observational\nstudy that uses machine learning with time series data from\nconsumer-grade smartwatches to detect atrial ﬁbrillation\nand heart failure. This will contribute to cost-effective cardio-\nvascular monitoring of outpatients, thereby reducing exacer-\nbation of cardiovascular disease and effectively increasing\ncapacity of global cardiovascular healthcare.\nFunding Sources\nThis research did not receive any speciﬁc grant from funding\nagencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-proﬁt sectors.\nDisclosures\nThe authors declare no conﬂict of interest.\nAuthorship\nAll authors attest they meet the current ICMJE criteria for\nauthorship.\nPatient Consent\nInformed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in\nthe study.\nInstitutional Review Board Statement\nThe study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration\nof Helsinki, and approved by the Institutional Review Board\n(or Ethics Committee) of METC-LDD (protocol code\nNL73708.058.20) for studies involving humans.\nReferences\n1.

MIL techniques align well with our time se-\nries data, where during the training phase only 1 label related\nto the subject (bag label) is known while the individual labels\nof the compressed windows (instance labels) remain un-\nknown. In the testing phase the primary objective is to predict\n1 clinical outcome for each subject. The key concept in MIL\nNaseri et al ME-TIME: CVD Detection Using Smartwatches and AI 167\n\nis that each bag of instances is labeled as positive (heart dis-\nease) if it contains a certain amount of positive instances and\nnegative (healthy) if it contains no positive instances (only\nnegative instances). Although traditional MIL approaches\noften classify a bag as positive even with just 1 positive\ninstance, we aim to minimize false-positives by setting a\nthreshold on the number of positive instances required to la-\nbel a bag as positive. This threshold will be determined\nthrough hyperparameter tuning. Thus, instead of learning a\nmodel that predicts the cardiovascular outcome of individual\ninstances, we are learning a model that predicts the outcome\nof a bag of instances.\nAlgorithm validation\nIn our speciﬁc setting where the model encounters data from\npreviously unseen subjects without any prior knowledge, we\nuse leave-p-subjects-out cross-validation (LPSOCV). This\napproach, shown inFigure 4, ensures a more accurate reﬂec-\ntion of real-world situations. LPSOCV involves multiple iter-\nations, or folds, during which data from distinct subjects are\nused for training and validation purposes (ie, the model is\nvalidated on data from subjects that the model is not trained\non), mitigating observation bias.\nMachine learning models are sensitive to the distribution\nof classes. To mitigate potential bias owing to different class\ndistributions in each fold, we incorporate stratiﬁcation during\nthe cross-validation process. This ensures that the ratio of\nnonarrhythmic, atrial ﬁbrillation, and heart failure subjects\nremains approximately consistent and that the inﬂuence of\ninconsistent class distribution across different folds is mini-\nmized.\nHowever, Fitbit time series data exhibit inter-subject vari-\nability resulting from individuals’ distinct physical attri-\nbutes,\n10 making the development of a universally effective\nmodel for “new” subjects challenging. In order to examine\nthe effect of inter-subject variability, we will assess the model\non 2 distinct test sets. Theﬁrst is an external test set that con-\nsists of subjects not previously encountered, randomly\nselected to make up 20% of the total subjects, with an equal\nnumber from each class. This allows us to evaluate the\nmodel’s generalization capabilities. The second test set is\nan internal one, encompassing theﬁnal 20% of data from\nFigure 3 Illustration of multiple-instance learning. The red and blue lines\nindicate bags of heart disease patients and reference subjects. Even though\nthe labels for each instance are not known, for the sake of this example,\nthe plus and minus signs depict time windows where heart disease is present\nor absent, respectively. The decision boundary is depicted by a dotted circle,\nwhere instances within the circle are classiﬁed as heart disease, and instances\noutside the circle are classiﬁed as healthy.\nBox 1. A simple multiple-instance learning\nexample\nMIL is elaborated with an example in 3 steps.\nInitial setup Under traditional supervised learning,\neach window must be annotated to train a machine\nlearning model.

Healthy participants are\nrecruited through local advertising. Anyone that is interested\nwill then receive an information brochure and informed con-\nsent form. At least 2 days after the patient’s receipt of the\nbrochure, the research team will call the patient to schedule\nan appointment. During this visit, the patient submits the\nsigned consent form and will undergo an ECG and blood\npressure measurement that will be analyzed by an experi-\nenced cardiologist (I.B.). Participants can use their own Fitbit\nand are otherwise provided with a Fitbit Inspire 2 or Fitbit\nCharge 5 smartwatch. The device type is assigned to a partic-\nipant at random to prevent device sampling bias. This will\nalso help to investigate the effect of device type on the perfor-\nmance of theﬁnal model. A Fitbit account will be created for\nall participants which will be connected to a custom-built\ndata platform using the Google Cloud Platform. Our platform\nfeatures a data portal for research staff to easily register or de-\nregister participants by authorizing a connection to their Fit-\nbit data. Data are extracted daily from Fitbits until the\nobservation period ends and can be analyzed either in the\ncloud or locally.\nAll participants will be asked toﬁll out a survey regarding\ntheir health. All participants are monitored for a period of 3\nmonths. After written consent from the 200 subjects, heart\nrate, step counter, and sleep time series data are extracted\nfrom the data platform. Clinical metadata such as age, height,\nweight, blood pressure at baseline, health survey, and medi-\ncation use are saved in the Castor (Ciwit BV, Amsterdam,\nThe Netherlands) electronic database.\nData privacy\nAfter performing a thorough data protection impact assess-\nment, the local hospital security information and privacy of-\nﬁcers granted permission to perform the study. This was also\nvalidated by the ethics review board. The data protection\nimpact assessment describes a data management plan con-\nforming to the European General Data Protection Regulation.\nTo protect the data privacy of the participants, all data are\npseudonymized. Only the researchers have access to the\nsensor data, and only the Principal Investigator has access\nto personal information of participants (ie, names, contact in-\nformation, etc). They have all signed processing agreements.\nSecond, the Google servers storing the data are only located\nwithin the Netherlands; hence the data does not leave the\ncountry, therefore conforming to Dutch law. This is done\nto have a clear data infrastructure both legally and technically\nto explain to participants.\nData characteristics and preparation\nThe dataﬁrst undergoes a process involving resampling and\nartifact removal. In our experience with Fitbit smartwatches,\nthe heart rate is nonuniformly sampled, with a prevalent rate\nof 0.2 Hz. Therefore, the heart rate is resampled to once per 5\nseconds. The step counter is sampled once per minute.\nArtifacts involving samples with numerous consecutive\nconstant values are",
        " learning is used, where each observation of the data has\na class label. This must be done with ECGs, since photople-\nthysmography or derived signals are difﬁcult to interpret by a\nclinician. This so-called labeling or annotating of signals by\nphysicians is infeasible for the large amounts of (continuous)\ndata required, and therefore semi-automated\n4,5 and fully\nautomated2,3 ECG labeling systems6 have been developed.\nHowever, these still require a lot of manual labor from contin-\nuously monitored users.\nTherefore, the objective of the ME-TIME is (early) detec-\ntion and prevention of heart disease by leveraging time series\ndata from smartwatches, a cloud-based infrastructure, and\nmachine learning algorithms speciﬁcally designed to func-\ntion effectively with minimal labeling efforts.\nMethods\nStudy design and data collection\nME-TIME (registered at ClinicalTrials.gov; ID:\nNCT05802563) is designed as an observational cohort study\nconsisting of 3 data subject groups, as depicted inFigure 1.\nThe ﬁrst group consists of patients with systolic heart failure\n(HF group); the second group consists of patients with docu-\nmented atrial ﬁbrillation (AF group); and the third group,\nserving as a reference, consists of healthy volunteers. The\nrationale for creating distinct AF and HF groups comes\nfrom their unique pathophysiological characteristics. Conse-\nquently, heart rate patterns that are indicative of these dis-\neases might also be different. The HF group consists of 50\nstudy participants with systolic heart failure, deﬁned as a\nleft ventricular ejection fraction,35% without documented\natrial ﬁbrillation. The AF group consists of 50 patients with\ndocumented atrialﬁbrillation (paroxysmal, persistent, or per-\nmanent) without systolic heart failure. Ejection fractions will\nbe assessed from echocardiograms that are made within 1\nyear of inclusion, and if this is not available an echocardio-\ngram will be performed. The reference group consists of\n100 participants without any prior medical history and\nwithout medication use.
