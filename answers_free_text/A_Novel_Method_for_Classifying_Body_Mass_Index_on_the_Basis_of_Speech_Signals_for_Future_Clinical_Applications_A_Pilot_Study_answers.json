Limitations and Future Work.In our study, voice data of\nsubjects were collected by a recording equipment in hospital\nsite and research center site. In order to apply real-time\ndiagnosis in telemedicine or u-healthcare system, additional\nand important studies such as noise filter, adjustment tech-\nnique,andhandlingofatypicalspeechinemergency,should\nbe performed because of noise or interference generated by\nnetworkorequipmentduringtelecommunication.\nOur method classified only normal and overweight\nclasses and used voice data collected onlyfromKorea. So, in\norder to more accurately classify a broad range of classes—\nsuch as underweight, normal, overweight, obese 1, obese 2,\nand obese 3—according to WHO standard classification in\nvarious ethnic groups, we must collect more and varied data\nsets.\nIn our classification experiments, the AUC with feature\nselection in the female≥60 group was the highest among all\ngroups,althoughtherewerenosignificantlydifferentfeatures\nbetween the 2 classes among surviving features from the\nfeaturesubsetselectioninthefemale ≥60group.Weconsider\n2aspectsthatcouldberesponsiblefortheoccurrenceofthis\nproblem.First,thiscouldbeduetoacombinationproblemof\nfeaturesinwrapper-basedfeaturesubsetselectionandclassi-\nficationproblems.Fromtheperspectiveofmachinelearning\nanddatamining,machinelearningforwrapper-basedfeature\nselectionisconsideredaperfectblackbox.Ingeneral,greater\nnumbers of features exhibiting significant differences lead to\nbetter machine-learning performance.

The selected features in each\ngroupareshownin Table 3.Allexperimentswereperformed\nusing logistic regression in Weka [46], and a 10-fold cross\nvalidation was performed [47]. We used the accuracy, true\npositiverate(sensitivity,TPR),falsepositiverate(1specificity,\nFPR), precision, and F measure as performance evaluation\ncriteria [47, 48].

Each\nsentence was recorded twice, and the value of each feature\nwas obtained by averaging the values of the 2 recordings for\nmorestablefeatures.\nAll features were extracted using 5 vowels (A, E, I,\nO, U) and 1 sentence [38]. For speech feature extraction,\nwe extracted 65 features from the collected data set. The\nextracted features consisted of pitch, average ratio of pitch\nperiod, correlation coefficient between F0 and intensity\n(CORR), absolute Jitter (Jita), and Mel frequency cepstral\ncoefficients (MFCC), among others [18, 23, 27].

Class Label Decision for Normal and Overweight Sta-\ntuses. Obesity and BMI research is difficult due to different\nethnic groups and different national economic statuses [7].\nAlso, BMI values differ according to physiological factors\nand environmental factors, such as residing in a city or a\nrural area. For instance, BMI values of a population in an\nAsian region tend to be lower than those of a population\nin a Western region, whereas Asians have risk factors for\ncardiovascular disease and diabetes related to obesity at\nrelatively low BMI values [9, 39]. The BMI cutoff values for\noverweight and obesity depend on several factors including\nethnicity,rural/urbanresidence,andeconomicstatus[ 7,40].\nTherefore, we decided that this study’s overweight cutoff\npoint of BMI value was≥23kg/m\n2, according to suggestions\nby the World Health Organization and references [39, 41,\n42]. We refer here to only 2 classes: the “normal” and the\n“overweight.” Subjects in the BMI who range from 18.5 to\n22.9 were labeled normal, and subjects with a BMI of 23\nor over were labeled as overweight. Underweight patients\nwere passed over due the lack of a minimum number of\nsubjects. Finally, we divided the data set into 6 groups for\nage-andgender-specificclassification:female:20–30(females\naged20–39years),female:40–50(femalesaged40–59years),\nfemale: 60 (females aged 60 years and over), male: 20–30\n(males aged 20–39 years), male: 40–50 (males aged 40–59\nyears),andmale:60(malesaged60yearsandover).\nThe overall mean ages of the female and male subjects\nwere41.79and40.51,respectively.Themean",

Therefore, it is important to recognize when patients are\noverweightorobese,andmanystudieshavebeenperformed\nabout the relationship of obesity, as determined by body\nmassindex(BMI),anddisease[ 4,6,7,9–11].BMI,proposed\nby Lambert Adolphe Jacques Quetelet, is a measurement\ncriterion presenting the relationship between body weight\nand height [3]a n dac o m m o n l yu s e dp u b l i ch e a l t hm e t h o d\nfor classifying underweight, normal, overweight, and obese\npatients.\nOn the other hand, research on the association of body\nshape (weight, height),"

However, we cannot\nguarantee that a classification using only significant features\n(i.e., those withP values <0.05) always performs better than\none using a combination of significant and less significant\nfeatures.Therefore,themostimportantfactoristheselection\nand combination of the features of each group. For example,\nGuyonandElisseeff[ 43]suggestthattheperformanceofvari-\nables that are ineffective by themselves can be improved sig-\nnificantly when combined with others. Furthermore, adding\npresumablyredundantvariablescanresultinnoisereduction\nand consequently better class separation. The other possible\nreasonfortheobservedproblemisthelackofsamples,which\ncanforceunder-oroverfittinginmachinelearning.Thesmall\nsample size is a critical limitation of this study, because our\nsample size was not representative of the population. Thus,\nthisstudyshouldbedesignatedasapilotobservationalstudy.\nIn order to reduce or understand this problem, we require\nmoresamplesandarecurrentlycollectingmoresamples.\nIn the future, we will investigate the extraction of useful\nfeatures that demonstrate statistical significance in all age-\nand gender-specific groups, build a more accurate classifi-\ncation model, and collect more data for better classification\nperformance. Furthermore, we will examine the association\nof the BMI with features such as respiration rate from\nnonstructuredspeechsignalsusinganewprotocol.\n4. Conclusions\nThe classification of normal and overweight according to\nbody mass index (BMI) is only possible through the mea-\nsurement and calculation of weight and height. This study\nsuggested a novel method for BMI classification by speech\nsignalandshowedthepossibilityofpredictingadiagnosisof\nnormal status or overweight status on the basis of voice and\nmachine learning. We found discriminatory feature subsets\nf o rd i a g n o s i n gn o r m a lo ro v e r w e i g h ti n d i v i d u a l sb yf e a t u r e\nselection. We proved that several features have a statistically\nsignificantdifferencebetweennormalandoverweightclasses\nin the female: 20–30 group and male: 20–30 group through\nstatisticalanalysisofthefeaturesselectedbyfeatureselection\nineachgroup.Ourfindingsshowedthepossibilitytopredict\nBMIdiagnosisusingacombinationofvoicefeatureswithout\nadditional weight and height measurements, even if signifi-\ncant features are rare and weak. The prediction performance\nwith feature selection was higher than that without feature\nselection. However, the accuracy and AUC achieved by our\nclassification experiment were not yet sufficient for rigorous\ndiagnosis and medical purposes. Therefore, we need more\nresearch about discriminatory features of broad range, rich\ndata,andamoreaccurateclassificationmodel.\nAcknowledgment\nThis work was supported by the National Research Founda-\ntion of Korea (NRF) Grant funded by the Korea government\n(MEST)(20120009001,2006-2005173).\nReferences\n[1] T.

The selected features in each\ngroupareshownin Table 3.Allexperimentswereperformed\nusing logistic regression in Weka [46], and a 10-fold cross\nvalidation was performed [47]. We used the accuracy, true\npositiverate(sensitivity,TPR),falsepositiverate(1specificity,\nFPR), precision, and F measure as performance evaluation\ncriteria [47, 48]. A large proportion of classification algo-\nrithms may not solve the class-size imbalance problem [49].\nThus, the accuracy of many classification experiments is\nhigherforamajorityclassthanforaminorityclass.Therefore,\nwe also evaluated performance using AUC. An ROC curve\n(receiver operating characteristic curve) represents the bal-\nance of sensitivity versus 1 specificity [50]. Because the AUC\nis a threshold-independent measure, AUC is a widely used\ntoquantifythequalityofapredictionorclassificationmodel\nin medical science, bioinformatics, medicine statistics, and\nbiology [31, 51–53]. An AUC of 1 means a perfect diagnosis\nmodel,anAUCof0.5israndomdiagnosis,andanAUCof0\nisaperfectlywrongdiagnosis.\n3. Results and Discussion\nOur experiments were divided into two steps. In the",

However, we cannot\nguarantee that a classification using only significant features\n(i.e., those withP values <0.05) always performs better than\none using a combination of significant and less significant\nfeatures.Therefore,themostimportantfactoristheselection\nand combination of the features of each group. For example,\nGuyonandElisseeff[ 43]suggestthattheperformanceofvari-\nables that are ineffective by themselves can be improved sig-\nnificantly when combined with others. Furthermore, adding\npresumablyredundantvariablescanresultinnoisereduction\nand consequently better class separation. The other possible\nreasonfortheobservedproblemisthelackofsamples,which\ncanforceunder-oroverfittinginmachinelearning.Thesmall\nsample size is a critical limitation of this study, because our\nsample size was not representative of the population. Thus,\nthisstudyshouldbedesignatedasapilotobservationalstudy.\nIn order to reduce or understand this problem, we require\nmoresamplesandarecurrentlycollectingmoresamples.\nIn the future, we will investigate the extraction of useful\nfeatures that demonstrate statistical significance in all age-\nand gender-specific groups, build a more accurate classifi-\ncation model, and collect more data for better classification\nperformance. Furthermore, we will examine the association\nof the BMI with features such as respiration rate from\nnonstructuredspeechsignalsusinganewprotocol.\n4. Conclusions\nThe classification of normal and overweight according to\nbody mass index (BMI) is only possible through the mea-\nsurement and calculation of weight and height. This study\nsuggested a novel method for BMI classification by speech\nsignalandshowedthepossibilityofpredictingadiagnosisof\nnormal status or overweight status on the basis of voice and\nmachine learning. We found discriminatory feature subsets\nf o rd i a g n o s i n gn o r m a lo ro v e r w e i g h ti n d i v i d u a l sb yf e a t u r e\nselection. We proved that several features have a statistically\nsignificantdifferencebetweennormalandoverweightclasses\nin the female: 20–30 group and male: 20–30 group through\nstatisticalanalysisofthefeaturesselectedbyfeatureselection\nineachgroup.Ourfindingsshowedthepossibilitytopredict\nBMIdiagnosisusingacombinationofvoicefeatureswithout\nadditional weight and height measurements, even if signifi-\ncant features are rare and weak. The prediction performance\nwith feature selection was higher than that without feature\nselection. However, the accuracy and AUC achieved by our\nclassification experiment were not yet sufficient for rigorous\ndiagnosis and medical purposes. Therefore, we need more\nresearch about discriminatory features of broad range, rich\ndata,andamoreaccurateclassificationmodel.\nAcknowledgment\nThis work was supported by the National Research Founda-\ntion of Korea (NRF) Grant funded by the Korea government\n(MEST)(20120009001,2006-2005173).\nReferences\n[1] T.
